🙋‍♀️ **A short introduction — what is GridSuite all about?**

GridSuite is an open-source suite of web applications designed to **operate, visualize, analyse, and design electrical grids**.  
It is built on top of the powerful open-source library **[PowSyBl](https://github.com/powsybl)**, leveraging its modeling, simulation, and data-handling capabilities to provide intuitive and interactive tools for grid studies.
